Currently support specially formatted csv-files:

- Exactly one single column must used as a primary key.
- Columns are separated by commas
- The header has a special format: "Name-of-table-that-is-referenced".#"Name-of-column-that-is-referenced";"Either-blank-or-#nameofcolumn-if-column-is-a-primary-key"
